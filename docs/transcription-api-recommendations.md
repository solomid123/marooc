## Implementation Considerations

### Integration Approach

For the Interview Assistant, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Client-side audio capture**: Use the Web Audio API to capture audio from the user's microphone
2. **Streaming to backend**: Send audio chunks to your backend server via WebSockets
3. **API integration**: Forward the audio stream to your chosen transcription API
4. **Real-time processing**: Return transcription results to the frontend as they become available
5. **Response generation**: Feed transcriptions to Gemini API to generate appropriate responses

### Code Example (AssemblyAI)

Here's a simplified example of how to integrate AssemblyAI:

```javascript
// Server-side (Node.js with WebSocket)
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const AssemblyAI = require('assemblyai');

// Initialize AssemblyAI client
const assemblyai = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
});

// Handle WebSocket connection from browser
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  // Create real-time transcription session with AssemblyAI
  const transcriber = assemblyai.realtime.transcriber({
    sampleRate: 16000,
    wordBoost: ['API', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'], // Technical terms for interviews
    speakerLabels: true
  });
  
  // Handle audio data from client
  ws.on('message', (audioChunk) => {
    transcriber.sendAudio(audioChunk);
  });
  
  // Send transcription results back to client
  transcriber.on('transcription', (transcription) => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'transcription',
      data: transcription
    }));
  });
  
  // Handle connection close
  ws.on('close', () => {
    transcriber.close();
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

We recommend starting with **AssemblyAI** for the best balance of cost and features. Its pricing is transparent and affordable for startups, while providing high-quality transcription essential for an interview assistant application.

For applications requiring the highest possible accuracy regardless of cost, Rev.ai would be the premium choice. For those already using AWS or Google Cloud infrastructure, their respective services offer good integration points within those ecosystems.
